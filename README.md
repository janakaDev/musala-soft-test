Musala Soft Test

Instructions
1.	Run npm install
2.	Run npm start
Then the project should be ready to use.

MongoDB
I have added ‘mongodb://localhost:27017/gateway’ as the db.
Please refer the index.ts to get the available endpoints

I did not have the time to do the unit testing. Apologies for that.
